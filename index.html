  <h2> The Dune Dress Restocked!</h2>
 
  <p>You guys might have seen me post this look on my Instagram before and it sold out so quickly. I am happy to announce that it is back in STOCK! </p>
  
  <button onclick="myTexts('home1')" >Read more</button>

  <br>

  <center><div  style="display:none" class="textstyle" id="home1">
   Go grab yours before it is gone.
This dress lays so nicely and it does NOT get wrinkled. Ain't nobody got time to be ironing so this dress is a major win in my book. It also had elastic on the waist that is hidden by the belt which makes it super comfortable. I am wearing a size small and it does run TTS. It has the look of a wrap style dress but it does not open when walking or moving around. 
If you need a simple yet stylish dress for any occasion or just for church this summer this is the dress. 
 <br>
Hope you all have a wonderful weekend (it's almost FRIDAY).

  <h2> JCrew Sale</h2>
 
  <p>I had to jump on here really quick and share with you all this beautiful dress from JCrew </p>
  
  <button onclick="myTexts('home2')" >Read more</button>

  <br>
  <br>

  <center><div  style="display:none" class="textstyle" id="home2">
   I bought this dress quiet awhile ago but now it is on MAJOR SALE! I would say this is a must have for summer because it is so lightweight and breathable. 
For size reference I usually wear a size 00 at JCrew but I ordered a size 4 TALL. Ordering the Tall version only makes it longer if that is something you are interested in. I get asked all the time how tall I am. For reference the dress falls below my knee and I am 5'4". I typically try to order the TALL option at JCrew whenever I can. <br>
Another tip for those of us that are ballin’ on a budget (you feel me!?) should subscribe to their email newsletter. They sometimes have 50% off their sale price and that’s the best time to snag your favorite items. This way you’ll be the first to know. <br>
Hope this helps and answers some commonly asked questions. 
Feel free to always comment on my most recent Instagram picture (@_mariahbrianne) for any question. If you write a DM I don't always see them or may take awhile to get back to you.

   Woooah, it feels like a long time since I have been here to blog. I wanted to share with you guys the beautiful timeless piece that will never get old. it is the perfect LBD! I am obsessed with the elegance. I have never seen anything like it. This is definitely an investment piece.  
I wore it 3 different ways. the first, is of course letting the chiffon scarf flow in the wind. second, I tied it around my neck like a neck bow and I loved it. lastly, I tied it around my waist which is not pictured (it was a bad angle lesss be honest here lol). 
I hope you guys love this dress as much as I do and I would love to see how you style it.

  <h2> Giveaway + Case App</h2>
 
  <p>Giveaway Alert!!!
You guys I got the opportunity to collaborate with Case App to share with you their awesome costume cases. </p>
  
  <button onclick="myTexts('home4')" >Read more</button>

  <br>
  <br>

  <center><div  style="display:none" class="textstyle" id="home4">
   I picked out the template White Marble and Pink iPhone case and customized it by adding one of my favorite Bible verses to it (Mark 11:24). The giveaway ends 5.1.18 at 6pm PST. 
how to enter:
<br>
1. go to my instagram (@_mariahbrianne) and find the picture with the phone case.
<br>
2. like and tag your friend (bonus for every other friend you tag) 
<br>
3. optional: let me know your favorite verse.
<br> 
 
Let me tell you guys a little bit about my custom phone case. This verse has been a favorite lately because I feel like in life we get so busy with our daily obligations and forget to put God first in everything that we do. Prayer is such a vitally important factor in our life. In order to Grow in God we must first establish a prayer life. I know in my life I often complain about certain things not going my way or stressing about what my future holds. I often worry about my plans and dreams coming to pass as I come close to graduating college but I have learned time and time again to trust God with with everything in my life. There is so much peace in leaving everything In God's hands in prayer. Since I have my phone with me 24/7 I decided to put this verse on my phone to remind me to set some time aside everyday to pray. I hope this post will encourage you to do the same in your life.

  <h2> Transform Your <br> Maxi for Fall</h2>
 
  <p> Hello Lovelies! I want to show you guys how you can take your summer maxi and use it for fall. </p>
  
  <button onclick="myTexts('home5')" >Read more</button>

  <br>
  <br>

  <center><div  style="display:none" class="textstyle" id="home5">We all love a good maxi and it is such a versatile piece that you can wear even when the weather starts changing. Once it starts getting a little more chilly don't put that maxi dress away with the rest of your summer clothes. 
You can easily wear some tights and throw on some booties. Adding a hat of your choice always gives the look a cozy vibe. Another option is to add a leather jacket or a bomber on top to keep warm. 
So don't shy away from wearing your summer maxi this fall and ROCK it all season, hunaay!

  <h2> Basket Bag Review</h2>
 
  <p>I have been eyeing the Gaia Ark Bag from Shopbop since last summer but I could NOT get myself to spend over $100 dollars on a basket bag. youuu feel me!?? </p>
  
  <button onclick="myTexts('home6')" >Read more</button>

  <br>
  <br>

  <center><div  style="display:none" class="textstyle" id="home6">
    luckily, I saw one of my favorite bloggers @dressupbuttercup (go follow her on IG she is so gorgeous) post the mot perfect dupe on her IG from amazon and I just had to share with all of you guys. This dupe is literally identical and I LOVE that I spent a fraction of the cost that the Gaia ark bag was priced. 
For size reference I am wearing the large and I kinda wish I would have ordered the small but I still love it. 
 
If you guys would like me to share more designer look alike items like this dupe, please let me know by commenting on my most recent IG picture. DMs tend to get lost sometimes and I am not the best at opening them. Please don't hate me but it is only myself running my IG and blog all while juggling a job and a full load at college. I'm sorry if I don't answer your DMs but please leave a comment and I will see that. 
Hope you have a lovely week!
